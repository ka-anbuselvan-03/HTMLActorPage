  Vijay is an Indian actor who works in Tamil cinema. He made his cinematic debut in 1984 with Vetri, directed by his father, Chandrasekhar.[1] After appearing in Chandrasekhar's films as an child artist, Vijay made his debut as a lead actor with Naalaiya Theerpu (1992) at the age of 18.[1] He followed it with a supporting role opposite Vijayakanth in Sendhoorapandi (1993).[2] Vijay went on to play lead roles in his father's directorial ventures such as Rasigan (1994) and Deva (1995).[2][3] Most of those films were successful commercially.[4][5]

Vijay's first breakthrough was in 1996 with romance film, Poove Unakkaga.[2][4] His subsequent films, Love Today (1997) and Kadhalukku Mariyadhai (1997), were critically and commercially successful.[4][6] His performance in the latter won him the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor.[4] Thulladha Manamum Thullum (1999), where he played a passionate singer gained him the reputation of a romantic hero.[7][8]

Vijay began the new millennium with critically and commercially successful films such as Kushi and Priyamaanavale.[9][10] The following year, he appeared in three films: Friends, Badri and Shahjahan. All three were box office successes;[11][12] barring successful ventures Thamizhan,[12] Youth and Bagavathi (all three released in 2002),[13][14] his subsequent films Vaseegara and Pudhiya Geethai were released. While Vaseegara was a moderate success and received praise for his comic-timing,[15] Puthiya Geethai received negative reviews and underperformed at the box office.[16][17][18] The success of his masala film Thirumalai (2003),[19] changed his on-screen persona to that of an action hero.[20] He appeared next as a kabaddi player in Ghilli (2004), which went on to become the most commercially successful Tamil film of the year.[4][21] His performance as a sword-smith in the masala film Thirupaachi (2005) earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards.[22][23] He continued to achieve commercial success with Sivakasi (2005) and Pokkiri (2007).[24][25] Barring Vettaikaaran's box office success,[26] all of his subsequent releases from Azhagiya Tamil Magan (2007), where he played dual roles for the first time in his career,[27] to Villu (2009) were average successes;[28][29][30] his 50th film, Sura (2010), managed to recover only its production cost.[
